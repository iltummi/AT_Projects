# Adaptive Cruise control for a virtual car simulator
The "Torcs" project has been useful for us to apply, in a practical way, what we have studied during the mobile robotics course.
Through the use of programs such as MATLAB and Simulink, we designed a path following controller on the track "Inferno 1" with the vehicle "car1-ow1 "which we schematized as a unicycle.

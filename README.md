# Model Predicted Control for COVID-19 using Sensitivity Analisys Toolbox
- The spread of COVID-19 virus and the strategies implemented by governments to contain the emergency have generated a debate on the optimal lockdown strategy to consider both health conditions and economic losses. In this project we implement a COVID-19 Model following [2] and a cost function following; the goal is to realize an optimal strategy to prevent the diffusion of COVID-19 epidemic using lockdown as control input for the model. An optimal lockdown, a first approach, is obtained by minimizing a cost function using Matlab Optimization Toolbox.
